[Aimeos](https://aimeos.org/Symfony) is THE professional, full-featured and
ultra fast e-commerce package for Symfony!  You can install it in your existing
Symfony application within 5 minutes and can adapt, extend, overwrite and
customize anything to your needs.

## Installation

This document is for the latest **Aimeos 2021.10** and **Symfony 4.4**.

If you want to **upgrade between major versions**, please have a look into the [upgrade guide](https://aimeos.org/docs/Symfony/Upgrade)!

The Aimeos Symfony e-commerce bundle is a composer based library that can be installed
easiest by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). If you don't have an existing
Symfony application, you can create a skeleton application using

```
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:~4.4 myshop
cd myshop
composer req friendsofsymfony/user-bundle
```

These settings need to be added to the `./config/packages/fos_user.yaml` file:

```yaml
fos_user:
    db_driver: orm
    user_class: Aimeos\ShopBundle\Entity\FosUser
    firewall_name: aimeos_myaccount
    from_email:
        address: "me@example.com"
        sender_name: "Test shop"
```

The Aimeos components have to be configured as well to get authentication working correctly.
You need to take care of three things: Using the correct customer manager implementation and
password encryption method as well as the right path for the storages. All must be appended
at the end of the `./config/packages/aimeos_shop.yaml`:

```yaml
aimeos_shop:
    resource:
        fs:
            baseurl: "https://yourdomain.com/"
            basedir: "%kernel.root_dir%/../public"
        fs-admin:
            basedir: "%kernel.root_dir%/../public/uploads"
    mshop:
        customer:
            manager:
                name: FosUser
                password:
                    name: Bcrypt
```

To configure the Aimeos routing, create the file `./config/routes/aimeos_shop.yaml` with these lines:

```yaml
aimeos_shop:
    resource: "@AimeosShopBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
```

The same applies for the FosUser bundle. Create the file `./config/routes/fos_user.yaml` containing:

```yaml
fos_user:
    resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/all.xml"
```

Make sure that the database is set up and it is configured in your `./config/packages/doctrine.yaml`:

```yaml
parameters:
    env(DATABASE_URL): ''
    database_host: <your host/ip>
    database_port: <your port>
    database_name: <your database>
    database_user: <db username>
    database_password: <db password>
```

Also, you have to configure your database credentials in the `.env` file:

`DATABASE_URL=mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name`

If you want to use a database server other than MySQL, please have a look into the article about
[supported database servers](https://aimeos.org/docs/latest/infrastructure/databases/)
and their specific configuration.

Symfony 4 uses an in-memory mail spooler by default which collects the e-mails and send them
at the end. This can be problematic if there's an error because you e.g. forgot to add a
sender address and all e-mail gets lost. The settings for sending e-mails immediately in
`./config/packages/swiftmailer.yaml` are:

```yaml
swiftmailer:
    url: '%env(MAILER_URL)%'
    sender_address: <your@domain.com>
#    spool: { type: 'memory' }
```

If you don't use Sendmail but SMTP for sending e-mails, you have to adapt the `MAILER_URL`
configuration in your `.env` file, e.g.:

`MAILER_URL=smtp://smtp.mailtrap.io:2525?encryption=tls&auth_mode=login&username=...&password=...`

## Composer

Then add these lines to your `composer.json` of your Symfony project:

```json
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "require": {
        "aimeos/aimeos-symfony": "~2021.10",
        ...
    },
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "Aimeos\\ShopBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installBundle",
            "Aimeos\\ShopBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::setupDatabase",
            ...
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "Aimeos\\ShopBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installBundle",
            "Aimeos\\ShopBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::setupDatabase",
            ...
        ]
    }
```

Afterwards, install the Aimeos shop bundle using

`composer update`

In a production environment or if you don't want that the demo data gets installed,
use the --no-dev option:

`SYMFONY_ENV=prod composer update --no-dev`

If you get an exception that the `SensioGeneratorBundle` isn't found, follow the
steps described in the
[Aimeos Symfony forum post](https://aimeos.org/help/symfony-bundle-f17/symfony-env-prod-composer-update-no-dev-t1488.html#p6384)

Start the PHP web server in the base directory of your application to do some quick tests:

```php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public```

Then, you should be able to call the catalog list page in your browser using

```http://127.0.0.1:8000/shop```


## Login and Admin

Setting up the administration interface is a matter of configuring the Symfony
firewall to restrict access to the admin URLs.

Setting up the security configuration is the most complex part. The firewall
setup in `./config/packages/security.yaml` should look like this one:

```yaml
security:
    providers:
        aimeos:
            entity: { class: AimeosShopBundle:FosUser, property: username }

    encoders:
        Aimeos\ShopBundle\Entity\FosUser: bcrypt

    firewalls:
        aimeos_admin:
            pattern:   ^/admin
            anonymous: ~
            provider: aimeos
            logout_on_user_change: true
            form_login:
                login_path: /admin
                check_path: /admin_check
        aimeos_myaccount:
            pattern: ^/
            form_login:
                provider: aimeos
                csrf_token_generator: security.csrf.token_manager
            logout:       true
            anonymous:    true

    access_control:
        - { path: ^/login$, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/register, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/resetting, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/profile, roles: ROLE_USER }
        - { path: ^/admin/.+, roles: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN] }
```

**Caution:** The order of the configuration settings in this file is important!

These settings will protect the ```/admin/*``` URLs from unauthorized access from
someone without admin privileges.

The `/profile` URL is protected by the FOS user bundle as well, which also offers
user registration.

As last step, you have to create an admin account using the Symfony command line:

```bash
./bin/console aimeos:account --admin me@mydomain.com
```

The e-mail address is the user name for login and the account will work for the frontend too.
To protect the new account, the command will ask you for a password. The same command can
create limited accounts by using "--editor" instead of "--admin". If you use "--super" the
account will have access to all sites.

If the PHP web server is still running (`php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public`), you should be
able to call the admin login page in your browser using

```http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin```

and authenticating with your e-mail and the password which has been asked for by the
`aimeos:account` command.

## Hints

To simplify development, you should configure to use no content cache. You can
do this by adding these lines to `./config/packages/aimeos_shop.yaml`:

```yaml
aimeos_shop:
    madmin:
        cache:
            manager:
                name: None
```
